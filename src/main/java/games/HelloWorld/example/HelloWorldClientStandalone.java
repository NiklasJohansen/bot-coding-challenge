 * the following code to run is the Gson JSON-parser from Google.
 *
 * The GameState and ClientResponse classes defined inside this class is used to parse the
 * JSON-formatted messaged into easily accessible objects. They should match the classes
 * defined by the server exactly.
 *
 * This bot simply prints the data from the server to the console and answers with a ClientResponse object.
